          <h3>General Information</h3>
          <p>
            The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
            athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighbourhoods an
            environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of
            NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago
            northside neighbourhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff and
            relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league
            members.
